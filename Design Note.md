Users will have alts, so we accomodate that. One user from the perspective of the authentication server can act as multiple
identities, so long as they can show a token permitting them to.

Sufficiently priviliged moderation actions do act on the user rather than the identity, but mostly you do just see identities.

However, an identity can introduce into a channel one or more characters, and speak through them; the UI should minimise indication
of who just spoke through a character. By default, the identity that introduced a character is the only one that can puppet it,
but this restriction can be lifted, and should be in PM channels.

One may speak in a manner indicating out-of-character-ness, or in a manner indicating narration. Probably wise to have bot notice
and moderator voice too.

Characters only HAVE to have a name and ACL. If in possession of a suitable token, one may also set things like profile URL.
